Leadership
======
* Co-founder and a member of the steering committee of the Michigan - Data Informed Cities for Everyone (M-DICE), 2020 -- present

The demand for improved cosmological simulations and computational tools has grown in the astronomy community, which is rooted in need for testing and validating survey-specific inference and data analysis pipelines. To fulfill these needs, the Baryon Pasting (BP) collaboration, an international team of >30 astronomers, statisticians, and computer scientists, is formed. BP designs novel computational tools, produces cosmological simulations, implements data analysis methods, and releases open-source software packages to unleash the full potential of data collected by large-scale astronomical surveys, and enhance the utility of astronomical data. BP has a number of on-going partnerships with the major observational surveys to produce survey-specific simulations.

* Co-chair of Baryon Pasters collaboration, 2020 -- present

M-DICE provides data-driven solutions to existing mobility problems for local governments.

In February of 2020, M-DICE embarked a partnership with the city of Detroit with the goal of providing a unified solution for managing and integrating disparate mobility data sources (e.g., traffic volume, census data, real-time bus data, street-view data), gaining insights into the mobility patterns in Detroit, and informing the budget planning and resource allocation. This project is partially funded by the city of Detroit to (i) designing a platform for integrating data sources, (ii) modeling street-view data, collected every six months, and evaluating the current condition of each road in an automated fashion, and (iii) designing and implementing a decision recommendation system to guide decision-makers which roads should be fixed in the next batch of the road maintenance cycle, which is currently done in a manual and ad-hoc fashion.
