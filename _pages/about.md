I am an astronomer who studies the physics of our Universe. I develop theoretical models, perform large-scale simulations, and utilize advanced and novel statistical models to discover the fundamental physics of our Universe. In the past 5 years, I have led a number of projects to support the science goal of many international projects and collaborations, including the Dark Energy Survey. I am also a dedicated educator who is interested in implementing novel educational models to engage with students. With my colleagues, I built the first data science education platform at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/) which teaches practical data science skills to students and at the same time makes a positive social impact on the local communities. Last but not least, I am a passionate data scientist who advocates for data science for social good. 

I am currently pursuing a dual Ph.D. degree in Physics and Scientific Computing at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/) - Ann Arbor. My advisor is Prof. [August E. Evrard](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~evrard/). The main area of my research is Clusters of Galaxies and Large-Scale Structures, with emphasis on multiwavelength modeling.  On this site, you can find some information about my research and extracurricular activities.

I am currently on the leadership board of the Michigan Data Science Team ([MDST](http://midas.umich.edu/mdst/)), a student organization on campus which brings together students, post-docs, researcher, and faculty of various disciplines through collaboration structured around finding patterns in data. The membership is open to everyone who is part of the UoM community. We usually partner with other local communities, like local governments and non-profits, or research labs to help them with their data analysis, data visualization, AI and ML modeling, and statistical inference. We are continually looking for talented and dedicated students who are interested in taking part in data science challenges and have a positive impact on our society.
