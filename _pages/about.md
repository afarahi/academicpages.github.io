I am currently a PhD student in the [physics department](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics/) at [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/) - Ann Arbor. My advisor is [August Evrard](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~evrard/). My main area of research is Clusters of Galaxies and Large-Scale Structures, with emphasis on multiwavelength modeling.  On this site, you can find some information about my research and extra curricular activities.

I am on the I am on the leadership board of The Michigan Data Science Team ([MDST](http://midas.umich.edu/mdst/)), a student group on campus which brings together students, post-docs, researcher, and faculty of various disciplines through collaboration structured around finding patterns in data, and the membership is open to all students around the campus. We usually partner with other local communities or research labs to help them with their data analysis and make sense of their data. We are looking for talented and dedicated students who are interested in taking part in data science challenges.
