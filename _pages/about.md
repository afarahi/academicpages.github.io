I am a [Data Science Fellow](https://midas.umich.edu/fellows/) with the
Michigan Institute for Data Science ([MIDAS](https://midas.umich.edu/)) at the University of Michigan. Bfore that, I was McWilliams postdoctoral research fellow at the McWilliams Center for Cosmology in [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in Physics and Scientific Computing from the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/), working with Prof. August Evrard on population modeling of the most massive gravitationally bound objects in our universe. More specifically, I developed novel inference models and computational algorithms to study the constituents of our universe and demystify the small-scale astrophysics, and active member of the "data mining" and "data science for social good" communities.


My current research focuses on developing population models to study complex systems, such as astronomical systems, urban mobility, and disasters. I have extensive knowledge of and experience in computational inference algorithms, machine learning, and statistical modeling of large datasets. On this site, you can find some information about my research and extracurricular activities. I was a [Schmidt Science Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/) finalist, recipient of the [best student paper award](https://medium.com/syncedreview/kdd-2018-announces-best-paper-other-awards-4835ab8475a4) in KDD'18, an awardee of the Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery and Engineering ([MICDE](https://micde.umich.edu/about/)) fellowship, and recipient >$50k grants. I am an active member of several international projects and collaborations, including the Dark Energy Survey([DES](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/)), the COsmostatistics INitiative ([COIN](https://cosmostatistics-initiative.org/)), and [XMM-XXL](http://irfu.cea.fr/xxl) Consortium among others. I am also a volunteer for Statistics Without Borders ([SWB](https://swb.wildapricot.org/)). Besides science, I am interested in implementing novel educational models to engage with students. With my colleagues at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/), I built the first data science education platform which teaches practical data science skills. Within this framework, not only the students gain knowledge in-depth knowledge of data science, but also do they make a positive social impact on the local communities. Last but not least, I am an advocate for data science for social good. 


**Undergraduate/graduate students**: I am continually looking for dedicated students at the University of Michigan (*you*) who are interested in taking part in data science with social impact or astronomy projects. These projects involve a balance of theoretical, methodological, and data analysis work. Experience in theoretical physics, astronomy, statistics, or computer science is a plus but not a requirement. If you are looking for a project feel free to email me.
