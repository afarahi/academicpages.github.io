---I am a [Data Science Fellow](https://midas.umich.edu/fellows/) with the
Michigan Institute for Data Science ([MIDAS](https://midas.umich.edu/)) at the University of Michigan. Before that, I was McWilliams postdoctoral research fellow at the McWilliams Center for Cosmology in [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in Scientific Computing and Physics from the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/). My research utilizes techniques from diverse areas of study, including statistical learning theory, machine learning (ML), optimization, and data-mining, to solve real-world problems in urban decision-making and astronomy.  On this site, you can find some information about my research and extracurricular activities.
 
[Danai Koutra](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/) and I have co-founded Michigan-Data Informed Cities for Everyone (M-DICE) collaboration that partners with cities and local governments to help them with designing and deploying data-driven solutions. I am also a co-Chair of Baryon Pasters collaboration that develops novel computational tools to facilitate modeling and analyzing large astronomical survey datasets.

I was a [Schmidt Science Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/) finalist, recipient of the [best student paper award](https://medium.com/syncedreview/kdd-2018-announces-best-paper-other-awards-4835ab8475a4) in KDD'18, an awardee of the Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery and Engineering ([MICDE](https://micde.umich.edu/about/)) fellowship, and recipient of >$400k grant funding. I am an active member of several international projects and collaborations, including the Dark Energy Survey([DES](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/)), the COsmostatistics INitiative ([COIN](https://cosmostatistics-initiative.org/)), and [XMM-XXL](http://irfu.cea.fr/xxl) Consortium, among others. I also volunteered for Statistics Without Borders ([SWB](https://swb.wildapricot.org/)). I am interested in implementing novel educational models to engage with students. With my colleagues at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/), I built the first data science education platform, which teaches practical data science skills. Last but not least, I am an advocate for data science for social good. 

**World Economic Forum Report**: I contributed to [a report from the World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/reports/digitizing-and-transforming-mobility-systems-lessons-from-the-detroit-region) featuring a data science project co-funded by MIDAS, U-M Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI), U-M College of Engineering and the Knight Foundation. The project is part of a larger Seamless Integrated Mobility effort that aims to transform mobility systems in Detroit, Ann Arbor and Windsor, MI. The project is one example of how data science can make a significant impact on policy making. 


**Undergraduate/graduate students**: I am continually looking for dedicated students at the University of Michigan (*you*) who are interested in taking part in data science with social impact or astronomy projects. These projects involve a balance of theoretical, methodological, and data analysis work. Experience in theoretical physics, astronomy, statistics, or computer science is a plus but not a requirement. If you are looking for a project, feel free to email me.


General Research Interest
------
My general research interest goes beyond what I am currently focused on. Here is a non-exhaustive list of my research interest:


**Main Research**

- AI fairness and Algorithmic bias
- Computational and approximate methods in statistical inference 
- Uncertainty modeling and quantification in machine learning models 
- Astroinformatics and urban informatics -- Data-driven and AI solutions for problems in astrophysics, smart cities, and urban decision-making
  

**Data Science for Social Good**

- data-driven public policy and decision making,
- service-learning,
- education, and public outreach.


**Cosmology and Astronomy**

- physics of clusters of galaxies, 
- galaxy formation/evolution, 
- cosmological probes,
- formation and evolution of large-scale structures.


**Miscellaneous** 

- topological and statistical properties of random fields,
- network theory and its application,
- non-perturbative methods.
