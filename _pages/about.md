I am currently a PhD student in the [physics department](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics/) at [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/) - Ann Arbor. My advisor is [August Evrard](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~evrard/). My main area of research is Clusters of Galaxies and Large-Scale Structures, with emphasis on multiwavelength modeling.  On this site, you can find some information about my research and extra curricular activities.
